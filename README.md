# Object-Oriented-Matrix-and-Image-Processing
I created this project during a schoolwork. I created a Matrix class which makes various Matrix operations. Then two sub classes inherits from this class."Table" class renames row and columns. The "Image" class is the most important class in this project. It inherits from the main class and can use its functions to;
Take a bmp file and do some operations on it like "erosion,dilation,opening,closing". This class can also convert a binary file to a gray image, and can do the opposite.
